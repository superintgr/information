# information
Constructor theoretic substrate for information processing and storage medium

In addition, information has a counter-factual character:

**an object in a particular physical state cannot be said to carry information unless it could have been in a different state**. As Weaver put it

> this word ‘information’ in communication theory relates not so much to what you do say, as to what you could say.

## Introductions

A massage that contains two possible states `x` and `y` is first instantiated in some physical variable of a transmitter device.

The sender of the massage will prepare substrate, onto which one of the blank state `b` of the medium is encoded with `x` or `y`.

Transmission of the massage requires the target medium to allow one of its receptive states to instantiate one of the possible massage states using the transmission medium.

Information to be possible, the variable which participate in the transmitters medium to send the massage using information variable whose receiving end also participate in the copying of the variable while the original massage remains unchanged.

Since the blank state represent the information variable for which the receiver substrate prepares a measure criteria by expecting one of the computation variable to assert any one of the information state from the possible set of measurable states, information property produces a copy of the commuting variable to remain at the substrate state for each of the end points.

### Notes

- **Information is also of the essence in `preparation` and `measurement`, both of which are necessary for testing scientific theories.**

- The **output** of a *measurement* is `information`; the **input** of a *preparation* includes **information**, specifying an `attribute` with which a **physical system is to be prepared**.

- A `process` that *distinguishes* **perfectly** whether a `message` is `x` or `y`, and *retransmits* the **message** while `retaining a copy`, is a `non-perturbing measurement`.

## Computation

Let `C` be a function that constructs a substrate `S` with an operator `PI`.

`PI` represents the permutation operation and `C[PI]` is a constructor with the task of permuting the set `S` of two or more states, where `C[PI](S)` is the task of computing state variables.

When `S` represents the set containing all the **computation variable**s and `C[PI]` is a possible task with side effect allowed, while `PI` permutes all of the elements in the set, the **computation medium** must contain at least one computation variable:

    `C[PI](S) := union(for all x in S) .. {x -> PI(x)}`

## Information

We consider two instances of a substrate `Š` where the substrate has a set `S` containing all of the possible attributes of the substrate type.

The cloning task `Ī[S]` of some information variable `x` using some `x[0]` as a variable unrelated to `x` of all possible attributes of `Š`

    `Ī[S](x[0]) := union(for all x in S) .. {(x, x[0]) -> (x, x)}`

on `Š + Š` where `x[0]` could be prepared from generic, naturally occuring resources to be contained in `Š`.

The cloning of information for all possible attributes in `Š` of set `S` is possible if `Ī[S](x[0])` is a possible task with side effects allowed.

- **Information varible** is a *clonable* `computational variable`.
- **Information attribute** is a *member* of an `information variable`.
- **Information medium** is a *substrate* that has at least one `information variable`.
