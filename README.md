Constructor theoretic substrate for information processing and storage medium

In addition, information has a counter-factual character:

**an object in a particular physical state cannot be said to carry information unless it could have been in a different state**. As Weaver put it

> this word ‘information’ in communication theory relates not so much to what you do say, as to what you could say.

## Introductions

A massage that contains two possible states `x` and `y` is first instantiated in some physical variable of a transmitter device.

The sender of the massage will prepare substrate, onto which one of the blank state `b` of the medium is encoded with `x` or `y`.

Transmission of the massage requires the target medium to allow one of its receptive states to instantiate one of the possible massage states using the transmission medium.

Information to be possible, the variable which participate in the transmitters medium to send the massage using information variable whose receiving end also participate in the copying of the variable while the original massage remains unchanged.

Since the blank state represent the information variable for which the receiver substrate prepares a measure criteria by expecting one of the computation variable to assert any one of the information state from the possible set of measurable states, information property produces a copy of the commuting variable to remain at the substrate state for each of the end points.

### Notes

- **Information is also of the essence in `preparation` and `measurement`, both of which are necessary for testing scientific theories.**

- The **output** of a *measurement* is `information`; the **input** of a *preparation* includes **information**, specifying an `attribute` with which a **physical system is to be prepared**.

- A `process` that *distinguishes* **perfectly** whether a `message` is `x` or `y`, and *retransmits* the **message** while `retaining a copy`, is a `non-perturbing measurement`.
