A typical computer logic is defined on what physical gates and interconnects allow one of two states of associated variable pairs could be evalutated at each step.

The communication is one way from pre defined registers to programmable variations of those registers thus always computing a function of single variable where the variable is realized through another function of same degree.

There is a overhead which cuts the possible degrees to a constant limiting voltage and all possible degrees are serial compositions of same limit cases.
