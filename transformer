Transformers are collected via a pair of coils.
. Coils are connected via magnetic field common to both.
. Changes are described in terms of voltage levels.

At the node endpoints, electric fields are producer of the voltage states.
Transformer defined between them transports energy between them.
Gradient information is collected through voltage differences respectively in ordered manner.

Constructors are required for dynamical transformations.
